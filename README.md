ITMD361 Production Problem 4 â€“ CSS data table
Objective: Create a valid, properly formatted HTML5 data table, fully styled with CSS 

Page working as expected on IE11, chrome, and Edge, but a few issues on 
Mozilla (latest version 52.0.1 on mulitple machines)

ran into 2 issues with mozilla:
1) the image swap with hover not working correctly, found a fix on
web but it did not work for me. Image flickers and stays on first image 
and never displays "hover" image.

2) border-radius rounding the corners but then displaying the edges also.
tried a few things from MDN site, one was not use border collapse, which I
am not using anyways. The -moz-border-radius syntax not working either.
